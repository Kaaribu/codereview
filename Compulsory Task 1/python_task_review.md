# Section A: Code Review
## Option 1: Python Task

### Review

### Correctness
The code correctly implements the logic to group anagrams together by sorting each string and using it as the key in a dictionary.
However, there is a syntax error on line 5 where the sorted() function is called without any argument. This should be sorted(i) to sort the characters of the current string i in the loop.


### Efficiency
The algorithm is good. However, there may still be room for improvement. It's worth mentioning that, if the input array contains a lot of duplicates, the performance of the code will be affected. To improve the efficiency, we could use a more efficient sorting algorithm, like counting sort, if we know the range of characters in the input array. Or we could use the defaultdict method which is dictionary type object that can help us arrive at the same result, albeit a little faster.

### Style
Indentation could also be improved. Remember, indentation in Python is very crucial and so if done incorrectly, it can induce errors. You can visit the following link to read up on this: https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_indentation.asp. Also, adding some comments to explain the logic and the use of the dictionary. Overall, I'm please with with effort. 


### Documentation
As already mentioned, there's no commenting provided in the code. It would be helpful to add a brief explanation of the problem statement and the approach taken to solve it at the top of the code.


### Improvements
Add the missing argument to the sorted() function on line 5 to correctly sort the characters of each string.
Add comments to explain the logic and the use of the dictionary.
Add a brief explanation of the problem statement and the approach taken to solve it at the top of the code.
Overall, the code has a good approach to solving the problem and has a correct logic. With some minor changes and improvements, it can be made more efficient and easier to understand.
