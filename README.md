# Anagram and Palindrome Tasks

This repository contains two tasks related to string manipulation: an anagram checker written in Python and a palindrome checker written in Ruby.

### Anagram Checker (Python)

The anagram checker takes in two strings as input and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Palindrome Checker (Ruby)

The palindrome checker takes in a string as input and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward.

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher (for anagram checker)
Ruby 2.6 or higher (for palindrome checker)
