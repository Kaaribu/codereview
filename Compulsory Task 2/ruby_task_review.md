**Correctness**
There are several syntax and logical errors in your solution: 
On Line 4: *false* should be *return False*
Line 11 *reversd* is spelled wrong
Line 13: *while num != x* should be *while num != 0*
Line 18: *num=num/10* will cause a type error because Ruby returns a float number when using the division operator.
Line 23: *false* should be *return False*
Line 25: *true* should be *return True*
The code also misses the closing *end* statement at line 28.

While I appreciate the effort, please consider rectifying the errors I've pointed out and give this another shot.

**Efficiency**
The if condition on line 3 *if x < 0* is not needed as it's returning false in any case. The function should always return a boolean value, instead of returning false or true, in order to improve efficiency. I get the logic used for the solution, however the use of the modulus and division operators to reverse the number, is also not efficient and could be implemented better. 

**Style**
The code uses proper indentation but not consistent naming conventions.
The use of a while loop to reverse the number is a good approach, but it's not implemented correctly.

**Documentation**
Although the code have comments, it doesn't explain the overall logic and purpose of the code, also variable naming could be more informative.

*Improvements:*
Adding a comment explaining the overall logic of the code would make it more readable for others.
Fixing the syntax errors and returning the correct values.
Changing the approach of returning strings to return a boolean value would be better.
Adding some test cases to test the function would be good.
Using consistent naming conventions would make the code more readable.
Overall, the code has several issues with the syntax, naming conventions, and logic that need to be fixed before it can function correctly. The approach of reversing the number to check for palindrome is correct, but the implementation needs to be improved with better documentation, testing and consistent naming conventions.
